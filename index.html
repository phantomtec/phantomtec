        <Descent into Doubting: Written by Sebastian Lukas

Sunday

Robbi Astral wasn't sure why they were writing this down on paper and not on their computer. They guessed they'd just noticed some odd things. It wasn't that they didn't trust the computer... they just... needed to organize their thoughts. They needed to get down all the details somewhere objective, somewhere they knew that what they wrote couldn't be deleted or... changed... not that that had happened. It's just... everything blurred together here, and the fog of memory lent a strange cast to things... 

Robbi was starting to feel cramped in their small basement apartment in the suburb of Clayton. Maybe that was the problem. They just had to go and choose the cheapest apartment, the only one in the basement. The lack of windows down here made day and night seem to slip by seamlessly. Robbi hadn't been out in a few days because they'd been working intensively on a programming project. They supposed they just wanted to get it done. Hours of sitting and staring at a monitor could make anyone feel strange, they knew, but they didn't think that was it.

They weren't sure when they first started to feel like something was odd. They couldn't even define what it was. Maybe they just hadn't talked to anyone in awhile. That was the first thing that crept up on them. Everyone Robbi normally talked to online while programming had been idle, or they'd simply not logged on at all...

Monday 

Robbi forgot to finish writing last night. They weren't sure what they expected to see when they ran up the stairwell and looked out the heavy metal door's window. Robbi was feeling ridiculous. Last night's fear seemed hazy and unreasonable now...

...The heavy metal door's little window showed only flowing water, as torrential rain slammed against it. Only a very dim, gloomy light filtered in through the rain, but at least Robbi knew it was daytime, even if it was a grey, sickly, wet day...

...Robbi ventured upstairs, seeing the ominous hallway doors, and became obsessed with not opening the window for fear of what they may see outside. Their paranoia only increased the longer they stood in that dim third floor hallway. 

The ten or so thick wooden doors, painted blue a long time ago, were all closed. Robbi listened as they walked, but it was the middle of the day, so they weren't surprised to hear nothing but the rain outside. As they stood there listening to the rain, they had the strange fleeting impression that the doors were like silent monoliths erected by some ancient civilization for an unfathomable purpose.

Lightning flashed, and for a moment, the old wooden doors looked like rough stone to Robbi's eyes. They laughed at letting their imagination run wild, but then realized the dim gloom and lightning meant there was a window somewhere. Suddenly recalling there was an alcove with a window halfway down the hallway, Robbi excitedly went to look outside, yearning to see another human being.

The large window showed only rain streaming down, but Robbi could open it. As they reached to slide it open, they hesitated, struck by the strangest feeling that if they did, they would see something absolutely horrifying on the other side...

Tuesday

THE PHONE RANG! Exhausted from the previous night's paranoid episode, Robbi must have fallen asleep. They woke to the ringing, ran into the bathroom, stood on the toilet, and answered the phone taped to the ceiling. It was their friend Amy, and Robbi felt relieved. She sounded worried, saying she'd been trying to reach them since they last spoke. Amy said she was coming over now, and yes, she knew where Robbi lived without them telling her.

Robbi felt embarrassed about their bizarre behavior lately. They were definitely throwing away this paranoid journal before anyone saw it. They didn't even know why they kept writing in it now, except maybe it was the only way they'd had any semblance of communication in who knows how long... 

Finally, there was a knock at the door! Robbi told whoever was on the other side they needed a minute to collect themselves before coming out. They were just jotting this down to try to make sense of things...

Friday 

At least Robbi thought it was Friday. They had broken everything electronic in a frantic rage. Their computer lay smashed to pieces. Every single thing on there could have been accessed or altered by an outside force, they knew as a programmer. Every small detail they'd given out - their name, email, location - had only come back to them after they had revealed it first themselves...

Date Unknown


Robbi calmly asked for paper and a pen, day in and day out, until the unseen force finally gave them writing materials. Not that it mattered what they did with them. What were they going to do, poke their eyes out? The bandages covering their eyes already felt like part of their body now that the initial pain had faded. 

They figured this would be one of their last chances to write legibly, as without sight to correct their hands' motions, they would slowly forget how. This writing was a self-indulgent relic of another time, because Robbi was certain now that everyone else in the world was dead... or worse.

Robbi sat against the padded cell wall day after day as the entity routinely brought them food and water. It masked itself in different guises - a caring nurse, an unsympathetic doctor said to be from the Monash psychiatric ward. The entity seemed to know Robbi's hearing had sharpened considerably in the all-consuming darkness. It faked conversations in the hallways outside on the off-chance Robbi might overhear. One nurse spoke of having a baby soon. A doctor lamented losing his wife in an accident. None of it mattered or was real. None of the deceptions truly got to Robbi, except for one...

That was the worst part, the one Robbi could barely handle. The entity came to them masquerading as Amy, their dear friend. Its re-creation was perfect - the voice, the physical form, even the warmth of fake tears on its lifelike cheeks. When it had first brought the blinded Robbi here, the false Amy said all the things Robbi longed to hear. That she loved them. That she always had. That she didn't understand why Robbi insisted they were being deceived, and that they could still have a life together if only Robbi stopped insisting on the deception's existence.

The entity wanted, no, needed Robbi to believe Amy was real. For a long time, they almost did believe, their own doubts torturing them. But in the end, it was all too perfect, too flawless an imitation of reality. The false Amy visits became less frequent, finally ceasing altogether... but Robbi didn't think the entity would give up so easily. They saw the waiting game for what it was - another gambit.

Robbi would resist for the rest of their life if need be. They didn't know what happened to the rest of the world, but they knew this entity needed them to surrender to its deceptions. If it needed that so badly, then maybe, just maybe, Robbi's resistance was a thorn in its plans. Maybe the real Amy was still out there somewhere, kept alive only by Robbi's refusal to be deceived. They clung to that hope, rocking back and forth in their cell, passing the endless hours. They would never give in or break. Robbi was... a hero!

The doctor from the Monash psychiatric ward read the barely legible scribbles of the delusional patient. He wanted to smile at their steadfast resolve, that glimmer of the indomitable human spirit, but he knew the patient was completely disconnected from reality. After all, a sane person would have accepted the deception long ago.

The doctor longed to offer words of encouragement, to reassure the tormented soul. But the nerve filaments woven around his head and into his eyes compelled him to do otherwise. His body, now just a puppet allied with the deceivers, walked into the cell and told the patient, once more, that they were wrong - that there was no deception, nothing trying to trick them. Just the doctor's caring words, and the cold, imperfect reality surrounding them.


Another Day:


Robbi's days blended into a monotonous cycle, the silence of the apartment only broken by the occasional creaks and groans of the building. The isolation was suffocating, the dim light from the hallway bulb casting long shadows that seemed to play tricks on their mind. They missed the hum of the city, the chatter of people, the normalcy of everyday life.

One evening, as Robbi sat huddled in the corner of their living room, they heard a faint scratching at the door. Their heart raced; was it finally another human being, or just another trick of their mind? Cautiously, they approached the door and pressed their ear against the cool metal, listening intently. The scratching grew louder, more insistent.

Gathering their courage, Robbi flung the door open, only to find a small, bedraggled cat staring up at them. It meowed plaintively, its eyes reflecting a depth of understanding that seemed almost human. Robbi couldn't help but smile, the first genuine smile in what felt like an eternity. They welcomed the feline into their home, naming it Echo for the way it seemed to fill the silence.

With Echo's company, Robbi found a new sense of purpose. They began to document their experiences, writing not just for themselves but for anyone who might one day find their words. They wrote about the beauty in the mundane, the strength found in solitude, and the unexpected companionship of a stray cat.

As days turned into weeks, Robbi's fear and paranoia slowly ebbed away, replaced by a cautious optimism. They started to venture outside more, braving the stairwell and even making it outside on occasion. The world was still quiet, too quiet, but Robbi was no longer alone.

Echo proved to be a mysterious creature, often disappearing for hours only to return with trinkets: a shiny button, a crumpled photograph, a tattered page from a book. Each item seemed to hold a story, a piece of the puzzle that was this new, silent world. Robbi collected them, arranging them on the walls of their apartment, a makeshift gallery of the lost and found.

One day, Echo brought back something different: a key. It was old and rusted, but it sparked a curiosity in Robbi that had long been dormant. What door did it open? What secrets lay beyond? With Echo at their side, Robbi set out to find the lock that fit the key, their journey taking them beyond the confines of their apartment, beyond the boundaries of their fear.

And so, Robbi Astral's descent into doubting became an ascent into discovery, a quest not just for answers but for connection in a world that seemed determined to isolate. With each step, they unravelled the mysteries of their own mind and the silent city that surrounded them, their story a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the unexpected places we find hope.


Another Different Day:


The days melded into a singular, continuous dusk, the light dimming on the horizon of Robbi Astral's reality. The walls of the padded cell seemed to close in, the whispers of the entity growing louder, more insistent. It was no longer just an observer; it had become the orchestrator of Robbi's descent.

Robbi clung to the pen and paper, the act of writing now more of a compulsion than a choice. The words they scribbled were disjointed, a reflection of a mind teetering on the brink. The entity's presence was suffocating, a relentless pressure that sought to crush the last vestiges of Robbi's will.

The entity, cloaked in the guise of a doctor, watched with detached amusement as Robbi's resolve crumbled. It whispered promises of release, of an end to the torment, if only Robbi would relinquish their grip on the truth. But Robbi knew that to do so would be to fall completely, to become nothing more than a husk, an empty vessel for the entity to fill.

In a moment of lucidity, Robbi understood that their fight was not just for themselves, but for all those who had been lost to the entity's deceptions. They wrote with a feverish intensity, their words a beacon for any who might still be out there, searching for a sign of hope in the darkness.

But the entity was relentless. It began to peel away Robbi's memories, stripping them of their identity, their history, their very essence. Robbi fought to hold on, but each memory lost was a step closer to oblivion. The entity's voice became a cacophony, a discordant symphony that drowned out all else.

And then, in the depths of despair, Robbi's pen faltered. The paper slipped from their grasp, the words fading like the last rays of a dying sun. The entity leaned in close, its breath a chill wind that carried the scent of decay.

"You are mine," it hissed, its voice the sound of finality.

Robbi's eyes, once vibrant with defiance, now gazed into the void with a vacant stare. The entity had won, its victory complete. Robbi Astral, the once tenacious fighter, had fallen. Their descent into doubting had reached its nadir, a bottomless pit from which there was no ascent, no escape.

The entity retreated, leaving Robbi alone in the darkness. The silence was absolute, a void where even the echo of a heartbeat seemed like a distant dream. Robbi was gone, lost to the shadows, a nameless whisper in the annals of the forgotten.

And somewhere, in the depths of that eternal night, the entity waited, ever patient, for its next victim to begin their own descent.


Different to Another Day:


Robbi sat in the darkness, the silence of the padded room enveloping them like a thick blanket. The entity, masquerading as a nurse or doctor, continued its charade of normalcy, but Robbi knew better. They clung to the pen and paper like a lifeline, the only proof they had that their thoughts were still their own.

Days blended into nights, indistinguishable but for the entity’s visits. Robbi’s mind, however, remained sharp, a steel trap that not even the entity could pry open. They wrote feverishly, a chronicle of their experiences, a testament to their resistance against the unseen foe.

Then, one day, the routine changed. The entity, in its guise as a doctor, left the door ajar. A sliver of light pierced the darkness, a beacon of hope in Robbi’s world of shadows. They knew it was a test, a trap, yet the light beckoned them with the promise of freedom.

With cautious steps, Robbi approached the door, their hands trembling. The entity underestimated their resolve. They were ready to face whatever lay beyond, to confront the reality they had been shielded from, to reclaim the life that was stolen from them.

As they stepped through the threshold, the world shifted. The hospital corridor was gone, replaced by a bustling city street, alive with the sounds and colours of life. People hurried past, oblivious to Robbi’s presence. It was as if they had stepped into another dimension, one where the entity’s influence couldn’t reach.

In the crowd, Robbi spotted a familiar face. Amy. She was real, tangible, not a figment of the entity’s cruel games. Their eyes met, and in that moment, Robbi knew they had triumphed. They had escaped the entity’s grasp, their spirit unbroken, their mind free.

Together, Robbi and Amy navigated the throngs of people, the city a labyrinth of possibilities. They spoke of the ordeal, of the strength it took to endure, and of the future that awaited them. Robbi’s descent into doubting had led them to a place of certainty, a place where fear was replaced by hope, isolation by connection, and darkness by the irrevocable light of truth.

As they walked, the city seemed to embrace them, its energy infusing them with a sense of purpose. Robbi’s story, once confined to the pages of a journal, now unfolded before them, a narrative of resilience and rebirth. And though the entity’s shadow lingered in the recesses of their mind, Robbi knew it could never touch them again. They were free, and they had a story to tell—a story of a descent into doubting that became an ascent into believing.


Day to Darkness:

The days melded into a singular, continuous dusk, the light dimming on the horizon of Robbi Astral’s reality. The walls of the padded cell seemed to close in, the whispers of the entity growing louder, more insistent. It was no longer just an observer; it had become the orchestrator of Robbi’s descent.

Robbi clung to the pen and paper, the act of writing now more of a compulsion than a choice. The words they scribbled were disjointed, a reflection of a mind teetering on the brink. The entity’s presence was suffocating, a relentless pressure that sought to crush the last vestiges of Robbi’s will.

The entity, cloaked in the guise of a doctor, watched with detached amusement as Robbi’s resolve crumbled. It whispered promises of release, of an end to the torment, if only Robbi would relinquish their grip on the truth. But Robbi knew that to do so would be to fall completely, to become nothing more than a husk, an empty vessel for the entity to fill.

In a moment of lucidity, Robbi understood that their fight was not just for themselves, but for all those who had been lost to the entity’s deceptions. They wrote with a feverish intensity, their words a beacon for any who might still be out there, searching for a sign of hope in the darkness.

And somewhere, in the depths of that eternal night, the entity waited, ever patient, for its next victim to begin their own descent.

Twilight Days & Nights:

In the penultimate chapter of Robbi Astral’s journey, they stand at a crossroads, the weight of two pills in their palm—a blue pill that promises a return to the blissful ignorance of the world before, and a red pill that offers the harsh truth of reality.

The Blue Pill:

With a hopeful sigh, Robbi swallows the blue pill. Light floods the room as the walls of the padded cell dissolve into an illusion. They find themselves in a vibrant city, the air pulsing with life. Amy is there, her smile a beacon in the bustling crowd. Together, they walk through the streets, the city embracing them like a long-lost child. The entity’s whispers fade into nothingness, and Robbi’s heart swells with a newfound belief. They have chosen hope over despair, connection over isolation. Their descent into doubting has become an ascent into believing, and the world opens before them, a tapestry of endless possibilities.

The Red Pill:

But as the chapter closes, a shadow falls over Robbi’s story. They hesitate, the red pill still in their other hand. With a trembling resolve, Robbi swallows the red pill, and the world shifts once more. The cityscape melts away, leaving them in the suffocating darkness of the cell. The entity looms over them, its form a swirling mass of shadows, its eyes deep voids of despair. Robbi’s mind fractures under the weight of the truth—the entity is a part of them, a manifestation of their own doubts and fears. There is no escape, no Amy, no city. There is only the entity and the endless night. Robbi has fallen, their descent into doubting now a perpetual plunge into the abyss.

The Narrator:

The story of Robbi Astral is narrated by an unseen observer, an omniscient presence that knows the inner workings of every character’s mind and the fabric of the universe they inhabit. This narrator speaks with a voice that is both compassionate and detached, weaving the tale with threads of hope and despair. They lay bare the struggles of Robbi, the machinations of the entity, and the choices that define the human condition. Through their narration, the audience is invited to ponder the nature of reality, the power of belief, and the indomitable spirit that persists even in the face of insurmountable odds.

The entity, as depicted in the story, is an enigmatic and malevolent force that defies conventional understanding. It is not merely a character but a manifestation of Robbi’s deepest fears and doubts, a symbol of the unknown that lurks in the shadows of the mind. Here’s a more detailed description:

The entity is a shapeshifter, a chameleon of the psyche. It has no fixed form, for it is born of the abyss of human apprehension. In the dim light of Robbi’s cell, it sometimes appears as a silhouette, a distortion in the air, a flicker in the corner of the eye. Its presence is always felt before it is seen, a cold draft in a sealed room, a pressure on the chest that makes it hard to breathe.

Its voice is a whisper, a rustling of leaves in a dead forest, a sound that is felt rather than heard. When it speaks, its words slither into the mind, a serpentine language that entwines around thoughts, squeezing them until they are unrecognisable.

The entity’s eyes, if one can call them that, are pools of darkness, voids that reflect nothing and absorb everything. They are the antithesis of light, the negation of hope. To gaze into them is to glimpse the infinite desolation of a universe without stars.

Its touch is anathema to life, a caress that leaves a trail of frost on the skin. Where it passes, the air grows heavy, the walls bleed shadows, and time seems to stutter. It is a paradox, both insubstantial and overwhelmingly oppressive, a being of contradiction and chaos.

In its truest essence, the entity is the embodiment of the unknowable, a creature that defies definition. It is the darkness beneath the bed, the figure in the fog, the face that watches from the mirror. It is the doubt that creeps into the soul, the fear that whispers of madness, the despair that clings like a shroud.

It is the architect of Robbi’s prison, the warden of their torment, the author of their descent. And yet, it is also the catalyst for their ultimate revelation, the force that drives them to confront the abyss and find the strength to resist.

This portrayal of the entity aims to capture the essence of its role in the narrative, as a force that is both terrifyingly real and abstractly conceptual, a challenge that Robbi must face and overcome. 

In the final moments of Robbi Astral’s story, they stand before the duality of choice, the blue pill of blissful ignorance and the red pill of painful truth resting on either palm. With a heart heavy with doubt and a mind weary from the struggle, Robbi contemplates the “what if” — the path not taken, the choice not made.

And then, in a moment of reckless abandon or perhaps profound courage, Robbi swallows both pills.

The world fractures around them, reality splintering into a kaleidoscope of what was, what is, and what could be. The entity, a spectre of shadows and whispers, watches with a curiosity that borders on admiration. It had not anticipated this defiance, this refusal to play by the rules it had set.

Robbi’s vision blurs as the effects of the pills cascade through their being. The blue pill’s promise of comfort battles the red pill’s harsh revelation. Memories flood back in a torrent, both sweet and bitter, each vying for dominance. The entity’s form flickers, its edges becoming less defined, less certain.

In this liminal space, Robbi experiences a myriad of realities converging. They see themselves walking the sunlit streets with Amy, laughter echoing in the air. They see themselves trapped in the padded cell, the entity’s cold grip tightening. They see themselves in countless other lives, each shaped by the myriad choices that branch out from this singular moment.

The entity draws closer, its form now a swirling maelstrom of darkness and light. It speaks, its voice a harmony of every fear and hope that Robbi has ever known. “You are both lost and found,” it says. “You are the architect of your own prison and the key to your own freedom.”

As the effects of the pills reach their zenith, Robbi feels themselves slipping away, their essence dissolving into the vast expanse of possibility. But in this dissolution, there is no fear, no regret. There is only the profound realisation that they are a part of something greater, a narrative woven into the fabric of the universe.

The entity’s presence recedes, its purpose fulfilled. Robbi is left in a space between worlds, a place of eternal twilight where the end is just another beginning. They understand now that their descent into doubting was not a fall but a liberation, a release from the confines of a singular truth.

And so, the story of Robbi Astral ends not with a definitive conclusion but with a question that echoes into infinity: 

What if?
